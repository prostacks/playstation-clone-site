### Overview

This clone site was completely built from scratch without any frameworks. This project highlights my abilities to be given a graphic design blueprint and recreate it with code. The website is fully responsive with tablet and mobile breakpoints. All styling was done with SASS and compiled into regular CSS. JavaScript was used for drop down menu animations, as well as scroll events for showcase images and headings. Images were used from the June 2020 version of the official [PlayStation](https://playstation.com) website.

### Technologies Used

- SASS
- CSS3
- HTML5
- JavaScript

### Challenges

This project was relatively difficult to make responsive for mobile and tablet viewports. It was also a challenge to figure out how to use JavaScript to make the menus switch depending on the user's input.

### Solution

Reading MDN documentation on CSS fixed positions and overflow helped me over come the challenges I had with making the navigation menus responsive across multiple browsers. Also researching and finding the JavaScript `continue;` keyword when iterating over the clicked menu items helped fixed the nav menu's functionality.

### Key Features

- Search Button Modal
- Scroll event based CSS animations
- Distinct styles for mobile & tablet viewports
