# playstation-clone-site

This clone site was completely built from scratch without any frameworks. This project highlights my abilities to be given a graphic design blueprint and recreate it with code. The website is fully responsive with tablet and mobile breakpoints. All styling was done with SASS and compiled into regular CSS. JavaScript was used for drop down menu animations, as well as scroll events for showcase images and headings.
